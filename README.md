## Overview
This repository is designed for Python learners and enthusiasts. It contains:
- Basic Python concepts and syntax
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Mini Projects for hands-on practice
- PyQt5 GUI examples
- Advanced Python topics

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```pwsh
   git clone https://github.com/dhanrajsinh13/Python.git
   cd Python
   ```
2. **Navigate folders:**
   - Explore each folder for topic-specific scripts.
3. **Run scripts:**
   - Use Python 3.10+ to run any `.py` file:
     ```pwsh
     python path/to/script.py
     ```
4. **Try mini-projects:**
   - Go to `MiniProject/` and run any project for practical experience.

## Installation & Requirements
### Python
- Recommended: Python 3.10 or higher

### Packages
Most scripts use only standard Python libraries. For GUI projects (`PyQt5/`), install:
```pwsh
pip install PyQt5
```
For some advanced scripts, you may need:
- `requests` (for API examples)
- `numpy` (for certain DSA or math scripts)
Install with:
```pwsh
pip install requests numpy
```
